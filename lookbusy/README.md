# lookbusy

[lookbusy](http://www.devin.com/lookbusy/) is a simple application for generating synthetic load on a Linux system. It can generate fixed, predictable loads on CPUs, keep chosen amounts of memory active, and generate disk traffic in any amounts you need.

```
docker buildx build . -t "einverne/lookbusy"
```
