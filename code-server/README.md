# code server

Code Server is an open-source tool that allows you to run a web-based version of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code editor on a remote machine or server. It provides developers with a familiar coding environment that they can access from any device with a web browser. Code Server is particularly useful for remote teams working on the same codebase, as it allows them to collaborate on code in real-time, without needing to be physically present in the same location. Code Server can be installed on a wide variety of operating systems and supports a range of programming languages and extensions, making it a versatile and flexible tool for developers.
